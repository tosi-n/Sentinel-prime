You sent me a renewal letter with a wrong date 1 day after expiry and thanks to you I drove 1 day without insurance and I made a phone call to renew the policy and the lady told me there was an error in the system and I was no longer insured and because of that I could not renew the policy and I would had to get a new quotation which after 15 minutes I have been told it is going to take another 10 minutes to finish the processes I really I wish I had an accident that day 3rd of September  just to take you to court for not being insured by AXA insurance mistake as I am pretty sure I would won the case and that lady on the phone she should have offered the extra day for free.

The reason I have said that they are excellent is that unfortunarely we had to use their services in April when my wife was taken into hospital while on holiday in Cyprus.As she was in hospital over our planned return date  they couldn't have been more helpful and contacted us to see what our special reqiurements were and paid all expenses including medical Billsair flights home extra hotel bills and transportation to and from airports.It goes withhout saying that when you find yourselves in situations like this it is very gratifying to know that you have the support of a good insurance company behind you.I would definately recommend this company and i have been singing their praises since we got back to the UK.

I went through Confused.com everything was going good until I went to make the payment using my brothers debit card as I did not have the funds  for the car insurance quote with his authorisation and got a error message code 105 unable to complete transaction After finally getting through to customer service explained the problem had my brother stood next to me give his authorisation to use his card only to be told there is no record of the quote I felt like was being fobbed offI went back onto confused.comback on your site found the quote had to transfer the money from my brothers account into mine used my debit card and finally completed the transactionWhy won't your payment feature accept payment from another person even after giving all his relevant info.
