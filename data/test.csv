have used two other insurance providers who were very helpful.

i have had a quote from another company which gives us much better cover for less than half of what we are currently paying.

price isn't super competitive, cover not as good as some other providers

whenever i have had to make a claim in the past, they have be incredibly efficient in helping.

we have had no trouble with direct line, but we also have not had a claim.

i had a large claim 3yrs.

i have never had a problem with this provider.

had a problem during a claim with poor legal service through direct line

their rates fluctuate a lot and their loyalty discount (for multiple insurance) with them is meaningless.

i have many policies with direct line and never had a problem.

they never give their best renewal premium first time

however, it is only by switching each year that i can get the best deal, never by using renewal.

it's good for me because i get a discount but not for everyone.

i was asked to pay for the cost of seeing a consultant as it was considered a pre-existing condition.

we really enjoy the benefits system of our health which encourages us to be healthier but when we have gone to use our private medical insurance the rules have been very strict and we haven't benefited much more than we would have done if we're using the nhs .

they are extremely helpful and never had a problem with them paying a claim

the procedures for claiming are tortuous and communication with the relevant staff is through phone rather than being able to exchange emails

they cover my car insurance and i've been disappointed with how they've handled my claim

Took a lot of phones to get them to complete on a claim
claim
person on the phone knows all about it
phone
and i was made to feel that she wasnt rushing me on the telephone

i asked axa ppp to contact me again in a year, i completely forgot about it and before my existing renewal came in they were on the phone.
phone
very friendly & professional on the phone but the systems behind the call centre are poor.
phone
they were in regular contact to help me get healthcare.
contact
have not needed to use the policy as yet but the sales team are really helpful and informative.
team
so an incredibly negative experience overall. something which i had hoped would just be a quick credit card purchase online ended up taking most of the morning
experience
however, i can respond how was the experience of the customer service during that purchase
experience
i consider it to be the wrong question as i haven´t experienced the true service this company/association provides to clients since i just purchased a policy
question
i suspect the problem was that i was pasting my password into the relevant field which may be blocked to prevent hacking.

he exhibited patience in giving tailored information over a period of weeks and supplied key documents on request for me to review.
documents
have not needed to use the policy as yet but the sales team are really helpful and informative.

my experience was quite usual compared to other insurance companies - that is to say, a greatly inflated renewal price, followed by a phone call to the axa which reduced the policy premium for the same cover, but i was told this was the lowest price that could be done. as it was still too high

no accidents in life no claim no concessions

i have been very pleased with the service in respect of my recent claim for the roof damaged in storm doris.

this is my second time using axa and i was given a discount as i alreally have a policy at this moment.
discount
also with having used a sister company, i was able to send an email with my current policy number and therefore have my ncb confirmed almost immediately.
ncb
quick response , less paperwork do not require confirmation of ncb through post
ncb
i had a discount on my second car with them.
discount
To top it off you didn't require proof of my no claims discount, unlike Hastings which sent me a passive aggressive letter demanding this after my cover had started and implying I might not have coverage until it arrived.
ncb
i asked for hard copy of the actual insurance certificate and this has arrived as requested.
certificate
and i was grateful that on request you sent me a paper copy of my insurance certificate.
certificate
the reason they did well is because they give me a call and offered me discount.
discount
multicar discount was a nice little bonus and bought my insurance down to a more manageable quote.

after a constructive discussion about this i was give a loyalty discount which brought the increase down to 13%.

i got £18 discount

easey to acess and cooperative with discount for multi.

i had a discount code from grand designs and that made axa the best deal.

the insurance was taken out online, i sent a no claims discount letter through and received a prompt auto email reply stating thanks for sending it.

so back to lv, they are not the cheapest, but when i did make a claim they handled it really well.
claim
i had a genuine claim and not being experienced with this type of problem the lv people i dealt with were absolutely brilliant.
claim
as lv requested a 'no show' this letter was impossible to get from ryanair as they wouldn't even accept our cancellation of travel - they are impossible to deal with but lv made no allowances for this so i have been unable to make a claim
claim
slightly ambiguous instructions when adding a previous claim - i discovered i inadvertently removed the information again by not clicking on
claim
used lv last year, had a slight accident and the company handled my claim very well, including legal against a third party that were at fault
claim
nothing bad, but then, i was fortunate not to have needed to make a claim!
claim
having made a claim on a previous lv home insurance i can tell anyone that it was handled very well by lv customer service.
claim
when the renewal came through there was no where on it, or on the online forms, that indicated the price of my insurance and therefore how much money they had helped themselves to from my bank.
renewal
i needed to review my existing cover and was very disappointed when i received my renewal, so i decided to test the market and axa came up with a better premium.
renewal
odd, had an existing renewal for home insurance with you which jumped from £235 to £305 (35% increase) phoned to ask why and standard reply.
renewal
having had my car insurance with axa for several years, when my renewal notice arrived from my buildings and contents insurers, i was staggered by several factors which seemed totally unreasonable.
renewal
received my renewal which i thought was too expensive compared to last year's price.
renewal
i would have liked the right price the first time i was informed of renewal, instead of having to bargain for a reduction in price.
renewal
price for the home insurance was lower than my renewal with tesco.
renewal
found your quote very good beating my renewal from my existing company.
renewal
renewal price is too high better getting a quote from them as a new customer have done this on both our cars this year and saved quite a bit of money their system needs to recognise existig customers with multi car discounts etc apart from that all good

my renewal price was considerably more than last year although i made no claims had to spend a considerable time negotiating a better deal.

renewal price was inflated, but after a quick call i was able to save money and the advisor made the process simple and pleasant

good price, as a loyal customer with m&s my renewal price was a joke, i will now always check the market before renewing my home insurance and will also check my car insurance prices.
renewal price
the renewal price quoted is far too high, i will call them and have much lesser quotes at hand and they, like all other companies will reduce my quote by upto £100, why on earth are long standing customers not given this reduced price on the initial quote, pure greed

i asked for hard copy of the actual insurance certificate and this has arrived as requested.

everything was so easy, from the renewal notice sent by email, right through to the new certificate being available to print on the actual day of renewal.
certificate
excellent customer service and despite an online company provided me a hard copy of the certificate of insurance by post upon request due to my printer breakdown
certificate
the first time i took out your car insurance i asked you to send me the certificate of insurance which you kindly did as i explained i could not print it from my laptop ; last year i still could not print and you kindly sent me the certificate as requested .
certificate
my insurance was renewed promptly as requested and my certificate of insurance sent to me by post.
certificate
they apparently do not employ the usual practice of providing an actual paper copy of the certificate of insurance, but when i asked if i could possibly have one, they were only too willing to provide it.

very helpful when dealing with a (non fault) accident.

how helpful you were after my accident in 2015.
accident
a recent accident which was not my fault was sorted with the day it happened
accident
used lv last year, had a slight accident and the company handled my claim very well, including legal against a third party that were at fault
accident
like all insurance companies i assume so it can wriggle out of a claim should there be one
claim
i don't trust the medical questionaires on insurance sites as you can never be sure that all the information given is enough for them to honour a claim - their reputation is to find some minor omission and refuse to pay.
claim
having made a claim on a previous lv home insurance i can tell anyone that it was handled very well by lv customer service.

half the price of my renewal quote from another provider.

£100 off my renewal price, with the same benefits!
renewal quote
an excessively high renewal quote for the same insurance.

i had been with this company for the previous 4 years and was sent an automatic renewal premium which had increased substantially despite having no changes to the policy

renewal price always inflated versus price given via website.

cheaper online price than renewal quote

service was very good but each year my renewal quote is much higher than those of comparison sites.
renewal quote
staff i called was helpful and easily cancelled the expensive renewal quote and didn't realise i probably could have just rung and got a matched quote.
renewal quote
had to ring and challenge the renewal quote to get it reduced wouldn't expect to have to do this as along term customer, best price should be given to all as a standard
renewal quote
i love axa, it's a great service, but my renewal quote was high and only came down to a decent price when i phoned to query it.
renewal quote
my renewal quote was up 15% on the previous year and higher than i was being quoted elsewhere, but following a very helpful telephone call, the cost was reduced to less than the previous year.
renewal quote
i choose axa as my renewal quote was almost double what i paid the previous year and axa was the next best quote for what i needed.
renewal quote
apart from the usual ridiculous renewal quote, the process of negotiating a more reasonable cost to insure was calm, efficient and positive
renewal quote
they didn't give the best renewal quote but after ringing them they did their best to sort a new quote
renewal quote
when i received my renewal quote it was quite a bit more than the previous year.
renewal quote
after getting a high renewal quote from my previous insurance provider, the price and level of cover was to good to miss
renewal quote
very pleasant members of staff who were knowledgable and although their initial renewal quote was higher than others they were able to bring this down for me.
renewal quote
the renewal quote was reasonable
renewal quote
we renewed our car insurance policy as we were happy with the renewal quote

i thought the renewal quote to be reasonable for what i wanted so i renewed
renewal quote
for once a renewal quote was actually acceptable!
renewal quote
renewal quote was cheapervthan anyone else.

this is the first time in years a renewal quote was lower than a new quote.

we had to deal with flood situation in our home that caused quite significant damage.

we dealt with three axa representatives in total - the first polite and helpful, the second (a building surveyor) inconsistent in his assessment of the risk factor attached to the state of the damage, and the third plain rude.

i felt as though my past custom (loyalty) was recognised.
loyalty
good to see existing customers being rewarded for a big of loyalty.
loyalty
axa now have my loyalty.
loyalty
they didn't increase my premium more than expected, showing appreciation for my loyalty.
loyalty
the whole thing is geared to rewarding new business and not loyalty.
loyalty
that's how you should treat someone who shows some loyalty.
loyalty
where is the gain for the loyalty of customers who renew their cover with axa?
loyalty
loyalty doesn't usually count
loyalty
money grabbing gits who penalize loyalty

great price insurance fantastic easy to use online service and best of all discount for loyalty!
loyalty
"they actually showed me loyalty by reducing my premium, with a great service."""

benefits are getting worse.
benefits
so far, vitality has just been a financial burden to me (for a service that was supposed to be a free job perk) and has offered zero medical benefit, as i ended up not having any treatment done.
benefits
They move the goalposts constantly to make sure that what looks like a benefit doesn't materialise
benefits
Examples are reducing the points earned for physical activity to make it harder to earn the benefit
benefits
couple this with the removal of benefits like non smokers cashback, garmin discount reduced from 50% to 25% and free starbucks drink size reduction, which you can't use if starbucks is a franchise outlet, thus eliminating the vast majority in my area and the policy is not what our company signed up for originally.
benefits
also the vitality benefits scheme has gone down hill it seems very difficult to get a starbucks or cinema tickets
benefits
every year changes are made either reducing the benefits or increasing points required to obtain them.
benefits
reducing benefits, increasing costs.
benefits
more steps required to achieve goals, more people required to achieve benefits eg cinema.
benefits
in sum so far, i have yielded no benefits from being a member of this scheme, on the contrary.
benefits
all the benefits were good at first, they're just getting harder to achieve and constantly change it's policy all the time.
benefits
continual changes and downgrading of benefits and frequent difficulty as an employer making changes to group policy
benefits
where is the incentive to become gold or platinum status if you don't get any extra benefits?
benefits
the benefits continually are reduced and the prices are continually increased, not a recipe for a long term relationship
benefits
we are required to earn more points to benefits from rewards and on the same side efforts are rewarded less points.
benefits
some high value benefits can just disappear, like non-smoker cashback of £150 a year.
benefits
the product is unfortunately backed up with a less than appropriate level of customer service and the arbitrary withdrawal of benefits and increases in cost.
benefits
i have been unable to access any of the vitality benefits since early 2016 because of problems with the member zone both via the internet and the app. despite making several calls during this time and sending complaint emails
benefits
having been a member for 3 years, have seen an annual decline in the benefits (loss of non smoker cash back, loss of gold/platinum incentives, proposed reduced points per activity) combined with significant annual percentage increases in premiums.
benefits
a lot of the benefits have ceased, smoking, nectar, national trust etc.
benefits
very good health cover but some benefits limited in scotland.
benefits
all good benefits removed, from a platinum member of last three years, vitality has gone down hill.
benefits
i have been a member with them for 11 years and over the past few years they have consistently cut member benefits whilst ramping premiums (and i have not made a claim for 7 years).
benefits
although i have been pleased with the level of cover, the erosion of benefits such as cash back is a little frustrating, as is the fact that the moves app does not work properly. despite copntacting moves on 3 occasions
benefits
the additional vitality benefits provided are good, but i have been annoyed how they are continually made harder and harder to achieve, with a combination since originally joining of requiring multiple members to gain points, increase points required while lowering daily points achievable and removing automatic achievement at gold status.
benefits
benefits are slowly getting less attractive, keep getting removed from the offer.
benefits
had my vitality plan for over 5 years and while the extra benefits were great to start with, they reduce what they offer or make it harder to achieve these benefits each year, yet the premiums increase every year.
benefits
benefits keep getting downgraded, service is ok, customer support is good, benefits are getting worse.
benefits
just not worth it , list of benefits keep being reduced while the cost increases over 50%year on year.
benefits
service and benefits keeps dropping-….
benefits
if vitality are this slippery on member benefits, i dread to think how they'd act if i ever needed to claim for ill health.
benefits
like so many things in life great when i took the policy out but they have continually chipped away at the benefits and removing the non-smokers payment was really poor.
benefits
reducing benefits every year.
benefits
benefits in decline, so for the first year of joining, 5* and all good.
benefits
the vitality scheme is good in theory but vitality health regularly reduce the benefits of it and make it harder to reach the target point levels.
benefits
i don't have the time to monitor trying to achieve the different reward levels of the policy and wish it were simpler.
reward
everyone has the same issue with the rewards, especially the cinema reward.
reward
the reward system is less good than before.
reward
it is time a policy was tailored for the older generation who simply want peace of mind that essential in-patient treatment will be covered at an affordable premium and recognises that the other reward benefits are irrelevant.
reward
then, they just removed the itunes credit reward with zero communication.
reward
poor cheap stunt to save money and remove reward.
reward
the rewards programme, which used to be quite attractive has been continually diluted and it is clear that when a reward becomes too popular it goes 'out of the window'.
reward
ok rewards - but even then, some cannot be used at all stores eg the starbucks reward.
