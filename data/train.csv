Very expensive for an experienced driver better be good for the price had an accident (hit in rear by 3rd party) seemed to put the insurance prices up the last experience with Hastingsdirect was a nightmare on the phone at time (talking to children it seemed used the words \ tough\  and \ ain't our fault\  very educatedjust didn't want to pay anything as if if was my fault someone nearly killed me - hope AXA different because \ you\  surely are in the most hated business.

initially the service was great but once we had finalised payment we realised we needed to ammend the policy start date from 2 weeks from the day of purchase to 1 week from day of purchase so both daes were before any cover had started and online we were prompted that we couldnt change his but to call up and they could do i but once we called up they said no they cant and that we needed to do whole new policy paying twice in total and then cancel the first one leaving us nearly Â£200 down waiting on a refund for a week for the sake of anadministrative change very poor control over there own systems we still havent had confirmation of the refund

I was especially pleased by the fact that a reputable company like AXA was able to offer me a reasonable quote for my insurance They will earn my loyalty if they continue to offer me such affordable offers in the future instead of joining the others in constantly increasing their costs under the assumption that too many of us are too lazy to shop around for a better quote every year.

You sent me a renewal letter with a wrong date 1 day after expiry and thanks to you I drove 1 day without insurance and I made a phone call to renew the policy and the lady told me there was an error in the system and I was no longer insured and because of that I could not renew the policy and I would had to get a new quotation which after 15 minutes I have been told it is going to take another 10 minutes to finish the processes I really I wish I had an accident that day 3rd of September  just to take you to court for not being insured by AXA insurance mistake as I am pretty sure I would won the case and that lady on the phone she should have offered the extra day for free.

However I think the service and level of cover is extremely good I am just confused at this point as to the inclusion of Tenants Liability which I bought separately before I took out this policy and seeing as you can't ring AXA during the process of buying the policy I have no idea whether I need have bought it separately or not or if they could have offered me the policy cheaper without it!

How you can morally justify not only your huge premiums but your refusal to take past experience into consideration and in my case over 50 years driving of motorcycles and cars in the UK and heavy lorries across Australia stinksEight years of trouble free driving with written proof from my West Australian insurer is rejected because of your unpleasant and insulting '2 year' rule for claiming NC benefits.

I didn't read any reviews about you or anyone else before deciding which insurer to go with my parents didn't read one my sister didn't read one and neither did any of the 20 people i work with so that is 0 out of 24 people read a review on insurance companies this month (to put that in context i saw an advert on tv yesterday stating that 71% of people reviewing an anti-wrinkle cream said it worked the sample size of that group was 24 people so a total of 14 out of 24 liked it and they base a tv advertising campaign on the back of that).
