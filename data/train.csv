How you can morally justify not only your huge premiums but your refusal to take past experience into consideration and in my case over 50 years driving of motorcycles and cars in the UK and heavy lorries across Australia stinksEight years of trouble free driving with written proof from my West Australian insurer is rejected because of your unpleasant and insulting '2 year' rule for claiming NC benefits.

However I think the service and level of cover is extremely good I am just confused at this point as to the inclusion of Tenants Liability which I bought separately before I took out this policy and seeing as you can't ring AXA during the process of buying the policy I have no idea whether I need have bought it separately or not or if they could have offered me the policy cheaper without it!

But far from feeling that I had come away with less which is what my previous insurers were suggesting to get the cost down including taking my husband off the policy to bring the premium down as a consequence of his car being reversed into I felt that I got more for my money and that had been backed up with a professional and knowledgeable service.

The reason I have said that they are excellent is that unfortunarely we had to use their services in April when my wife was taken into hospital while on holiday in Cyprus.As she was in hospital over our planned return date  they couldn't have been more helpful and contacted us to see what our special reqiurements were and paid all expenses including medical Billsair flights home extra hotel bills and transportation to and from airports.It goes withhout saying that when you find yourselves in situations like this it is very gratifying to know that you have the support of a good insurance company behind you.I would definately recommend this company and i have been singing their praises since we got back to the UK.

I didn't read any reviews about you or anyone else before deciding which insurer to go with my parents didn't read one my sister didn't read one and neither did any of the 20 people i work with so that is 0 out of 24 people read a review on insurance companies this month (to put that in context i saw an advert on tv yesterday stating that 71% of people reviewing an anti-wrinkle cream said it worked the sample size of that group was 24 people so a total of 14 out of 24 liked it and they base a tv advertising campaign on the back of that).

this process was extremely upsetting and stressful however the insurance team attended to assess the damage and the overview of the claim was provided and handled very professionallythe stress continued with the repeated enquiry regarding the damage caused and value of claimalthough this has been resolved i do not want to go through this process againbetter handling would be advised if i did not have to chase up enquiry after enquiry to ensure that the damage caused was identified and covered by the claim

After trolling through the car insurance market to find most insurance providers were asking on average Â£1000 more than I paid last year I finally came across axa who was the cheapest at Â£140 than I paid last year to axa I say thank you to the others I say that you are committing legalised theft
